I started as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at BYU in April 2019. My research interests are spatial/spatiotemporal statistics, time series analysis, functional data analysis, hierarchical modeling, and Bayesian statistics. I enjoy working on applied problems.

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistical Science at Duke University in January 2019. Alan Gelfand was my dissertation advisor. Prior to Duke, I completed a B.S. in Applied Physics and an M.S. in Statistics at BYU. 

Outside of my work, I enjoy spending time with my wife (Laurel) and my three sons, and enjoy spending my free time with my family. At heart, I'm a homebody who enjoys cooking/baking, playing music, but I also love getting outdoors and traveling.
