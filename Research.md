## Current Projects

My primary methodological areas of interest are in spatial statistics, time series, and functional data analysis. I am interested in many application areas. Currently, I am working on projects that fall into one or more of the following areas:

- Applied environmental and climate data problems.
- Hierarchical spatial modeling of functional data. In this area, I am particularly interested in the fusion of physical and statistical models.
- Developing valid (cross-)covariance models for spherical domains with applications to global data and continuously indexed seasonal time-series.
- Dependent point processes with applications in public policy and traffic engineering.
