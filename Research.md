## Current Projects

My primary methodological areas of interest are in spatial statistics, time series, and functional data analysis. I am interested in many application areas. 

I am working on a few projects in pollution monitoring, including synthesizing data from stationary and mobile pollution monitors. In addition, I am interested in functional data analysis and have been developing methods for working with pollutants as multivariate functional data. I have worked on developing valid (cross-)covariance models for specific domains. I am working on point process modeling with applications in public policy and traffic engineering. I am also working on projects in ice sheet modeling with various goals.
